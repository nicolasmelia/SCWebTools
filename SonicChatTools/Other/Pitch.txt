Hello,  I'm Nicolas Melia. 

I am the founder, and sole software engineer behind SonicChat LLC.  
I am located in Cleveland ohio and am currently 
searching for a business incubator willing to fund my innovative product.

SonicChat LLC is an All-In-One, intuitive, customer support web widget 
that was designed to be simple to use, easily implemented and extremely 
versatile. You can customize SonicChat by selecting tiles that fit your 
business needs best. Tiles include, chat, ticket, map, feedback,
 appointment, custom forms, and many more. To learn more about SonicChat, 
ask it yourself! Go to SonicChats.com (on PC or Mac), click on the 
widget in the lower right hand corner, then click the AnswerBase tile. 
Ask it "Why is SonicChat awesome?" (type exactly) and hit enter. Sit 
back, make sure your sound is on and enjoy the next great software solution.

SonicChat is attempting to take a step in a multi-million dollar market with its innovative
take on internet based support solutions. If you also see potential in SonicChat, contact me anytime. 

Thank you.

Nicolas Melia. 
Founder of SonicChat.
